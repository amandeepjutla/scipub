The scipub package contains functions for summarizing data
    for scientific publication. This includes making a "Table 1"
    to summarize demographics across groups, correlation tables
    with significance indicated by stars, and extracting formatted
    statistical summarizes from simple tests for in-text notation.
    The package also includes functions for Winsorizing data based
    on a Z-statistic cutoff.  
The `ggplot2::diamonds` dataset is used for examples.  



***
We'll start by loading scipub:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(scipub)
library(knitr)
```

## `apastat`

The `apastat` function summarizes simple statistical tests to include 
in the text of an article, typically in a parenthetical. 
This is built for t-tests, correlations, anova, and regression.
Regressions can be summarized by their overall model fit or the
parameter estimates for one predictor variable.
Effect sizes are calculated where possible (default: `es=TRUE`). 
For example:



There is a significant negative correlation between diamond depth and price.
```{r}
apastat(stats::cor.test(diamonds$depth, diamonds$price), ci = TRUE)
```

Ideal cut diamonds are of significantly higher price than good cut diamonds at a small effect size.
```{r}
apastat(stats::t.test(price ~ cut, data = diamonds[diamonds$cut == "Ideal" | diamonds$cut == "Good", ]))
```

Ideal cut diamonds are of significantly higher price than good cut diamonds at a small effect size.
```{r}
apastat(stats::t.test(price ~ cut, data = diamonds[diamonds$cut == "Ideal" | diamonds$cut == "Good", ]))
```

The linear regression model predicting diamond price was highly signficant, with the predictors (cut, depth, and carat) accounting for a majority of variance in price. 
```{r}
apastat(stats::lm(data = diamonds[diamonds$cut == "Ideal" | diamonds$cut == "Good", ],  price ~ cut + depth + carat))
```

In that linear regression model, carat was a highly significant predictor of price, contrlling for cut and depth. 
```{r}
apastat(stats::lm(data = diamonds[diamonds$cut == "Ideal" | diamonds$cut == "Good", ], price ~ cut + depth + carat), var = "carat")
```





***
## `correltable`

The `correltable` function creates a summary correlation table with astericks to indicate significance. 
Variables can be renamed as part of the function call. The full matrix or upper/lower triangle can be selected for outtput. For the selected triangle, the empty row/column can be kept or deleted as needed. 
The caption provides information on the statistics included, any missing data, and the * indications. 
For example:

The lower triangle of inter-correlation among the carat, depth, and price variables are shown.
```{r results="asis"}
correltable(data = diamonds, vars = c("carat", "depth", "price"),tri="lower",html=TRUE)
correltable(data = diamonds, vars = c("carat", "depth", "price"),tri="lower",html=FALSE)
kable(correltable(data = diamonds, vars = c("carat", "depth", "price"),tri="lower",html=TRUE))
kable(correltable(data = diamonds, vars = c("carat", "depth", "price"),tri="lower",html=FALSE))

```



These same variables can be relabelled in the output and, for conciseness, the columns can be indicated by corresponding number rather than variable name. 
```{r results="asis"}
correltable(data = diamonds, vars = c("carat", "depth", "price"), var_names = c("Carat", "Depth", "Price ($)"), tri = "upper", colnum = TRUE)
```



These inter-correlation between two sets of variables. 
```{r results="asis"}
correltable(data = diamonds, vars = c("carat", "depth", "price"), var_names = c("Carat", "Depth", "Price ($)"), vars2 = c("x", "y", "z"))
```


The simplest 
correltable(data = diamonds)





Ideal cut diamonds are of significantly higher price than good cut diamonds at a small effect size.
```{r results="asis"}
FullTable1(   data = diamonds[(diamonds$cut == "Ideal" | diamonds$cut == "Good") & (diamonds$color == "D" | diamonds$color == "J"), ],   vars = c("cut", "depth", "price"), strata = "color", html=TRUE)

```

The linear regression model predicting diamond price was highly signficant, with the predictors (cut, depth, and carat) accounting for a majority of variance in price. 
```{r}
apastat(stats::lm(data = diamonds[diamonds$cut == "Ideal" | diamonds$cut == "Good", ],  price ~ cut + depth + carat))
```

In that linear regression model, carat was a highly significant predictor of price, contrlling for cut and depth. 
```{r}
apastat(stats::lm(data = diamonds[diamonds$cut == "Ideal" | diamonds$cut == "Good", ], price ~ cut + depth + carat), var = "carat")
```
